# Users Don't See Cluster After Invite (IAM fix)

Sometimes users can not see their clusters in IBM Cloud web dashboard. Run the following commands:

1. Log in IBM Cloud via CLI:
```
ibmcloud login --sso
```

2. Select the problem account.

3. Switch to `itzroks` resource group.
```
ibmcloud target -g itzroks
```

4. List clusters:
```
ibmcloud ks cluster ls
```

Done. User should see his/her cluster in CLI and Web.
